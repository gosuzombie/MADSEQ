{"name":"MADSEQ","tagline":"MADSEQ - An R package for mosaic aneuploidy detection","body":"### Welcome to R/MADSEQ.\r\n**MADSEQ** is an R package designed for **mosaic aneuploidy detection and quantification** using next generation sequencing data. MADSEQ package contains a group of hierarchical Bayesian models for the detection of different types of mosaic aneuploidy. These models use Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to sample posterior distribution for different parameters related to mosaic aneuploidy.     \r\n      \r\nThe MADSEQ package can be used for the following purpose:  \r\n\r\n* Sensitive detection of mosaic aneuploidy\r\n* Quantification of the level of mosaic aneuploidy \r\n* Inference of the origin of aneuploidy\r\n\r\n### Dependencies\r\n  \r\n* R (latest version)\r\n* [JAGS](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net) installed on your computer\r\n* R package: rjags, visit their [cran page](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rjags/index.html) or [github](https://github.com/cran/rjags) for the instruction to install it.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nThe package could be installed by:\r\n\r\n1. Download TAR, and install it in R by:\r\n```{r}\r\ninstall.packages(\"directory_to_the_downloaded_package/file_name_MADSEQ.tar.gz\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Install it from github using `devtools`:\r\n```{r}\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"ykong2/MADSEQ\", build_vignettes=TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### User Guide\r\nThe [documentation](documentation.html) of MADSEQ package can be found [here](documentation.html). Please follow the instructions for the data preparation, model application and analysis.\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor help, new feature request or report bug regarding MADSEQ package, please contact at <yu.kong@phd.einstein.yu.edu>.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
